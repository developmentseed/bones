# Bones

Bones provides conventions for [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) applications. It allows most code to be shared on the server and the client. Bones exposes your Backbone routes as regular paths on the server so they can be accessed by non-JavaScript agents, while capable clients can enjoy the normal client-side Backbone experience.
